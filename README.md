# SIMPAT-Verification
This repository contains files that we made for the experiments from the paper "Design and Verification of a Mobile Robot based on the Integrated Model of Cyber-Physical Systems" (Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory).

In the experiments we worked with SPASS theorem prover, the Maude system and daTac. We used these tools to investigate different possibilities to build a cyber-physical system based on available building blocks. For each of this tool we developed appropriate specifications which full descriptions are presented in this GitHub repository.
